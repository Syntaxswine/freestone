# Freestone backlog

Milestones are defined in [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) §13. Each milestone ends with a push.

## Now
- [x] M0 — Scope document + research anchors (2026-07-09)
- [x] M0.5 — Granary/commons/small-works integration (2026-07-09): civic thesis (mutual aid +
      mutual defense) as pillars 6-7, new §8a (granary, Great Barn, seed corn, gleaning,
      commons, foraging year) + §8b (small works catalog, honest-dating filtered), siege
      rework (stores-vs-patience), tracing-floor palimpsest + page of unnamed hands (§9.7-8).
      Research: 6 agents, 78 claims, 18 skeptic checks → research/DIGEST-2026-07-09-*.md
- [x] Title RESOLVED 2026-07-09: **Castle Cultivator** (repo keeps codename `freestone`)
- [x] Wishlist dispositions integrated (2026-07-09): technique system CORE (§7), clerk (§7),
      farm animals not wildlife (§7), bell + construction chime (§6), hands-off trade +
      prosperity tiers (§8c), eel easter egg (§8a), fire + firefighting + curfew bell (§8),
      real-site directive (§5a). Parked: name-erosion, traveling masons. Research pass 3
      (fire/Kenilworth/Guédelon): 9 agents, 38 claims → anchors 21-23.
- [x] Q8 RESOLVED 2026-07-09: **DURHAM confirmed** by boss ("start with this one; more
      locations later") → sites are data packages loaded by id, future locations = content
- [ ] M1 groundwork IN PROGRESS: deterministic `worldStep` core + seed-first RNG +
      command-log save format + project scaffold (TS/Three/Vite, port 8742) + real Durham
      terrain (EA LiDAR 1m preferred, OS Terrain 50 fallback) → data/site-durham/
- [ ] Boss review of remaining SCOPE.md open questions (§14): player identity, era, combat
      flavor, idle tolerance, chapel long-game scope, Q7 tone ceiling (refeeding stays /
      expulsion refused)

## Next
- [ ] M1 — First Wall: terrain, camera, wall-line drawing, instanced stone accretion,
      stub workers. Acceptance: watching a wall grow for 5 minutes is *pleasant*.
- [ ] M1 groundwork: deterministic `worldStep` skeleton + seed-first RNG + event-log save
      format (before any rendering — the sim law comes first)

## Later (ordered)
- [ ] M2 — Quarry loop end-to-end with per-stone provenance
- [ ] M3 — Generations: people, trades, apprenticeship, marks, chronicle skeleton
- [ ] M4 — The granary year: harvest→sheaves→threshing→granary + seed corn, foraging
      calendar, gleaning, famine / disease / accidents / winter, Great Barn tutorial work;
      tuned by headless sweep
- [ ] M5 — Homage & small works: chronicle book, mark inspection, memorials, Long Replay,
      tracing-floor palimpsest, page of unnamed hands, small-works system (§8b)
- [ ] M6 — Combat toggle
- [ ] M7 — Weathering, audio, Steam packaging

## Open threads
- Verify any research anchors marked PARTLY/UNVERIFIED in SCOPE.md §15 before the
  corresponding mechanic ships (house law: cross-check research disagreements). Known PARTLY
  from the second pass: winter-foraging thinness, villagers-shelter-in-castle framing
  ("attested in emergencies", not "customary"), the word "banker mason" itself (practice
  medieval, term possibly later), bell "me fecit" dating, the ~50% wild-taxa archaeobotany
  figure (snippet-level only).
- Title resolved (Castle Cultivator); rename of repo/dir deferred until worth the link churn.
- Wishlist items #1/#7 (technique tokens, person mobility) should shape M3's people-sim data
  layout even if the features land later; #2 (real beds) belongs in M2's design from day one
  — cheap to found, expensive to retrofit.
- M1/M2 site work (once Q8 confirmed): pull EA LiDAR 1 m DTM + BGS 50k mapping for the
  chosen site; de-modernization pass; download + hand-transcribe the borehole log scans in
  the map box into the bed model (budget real hours — they're raster scans); grab the Mining
  Remediation Authority abandoned-mine GeoPackage; study the BGS GeoIndex synthetic-borehole
  viewer as the UX reference for our bed-query tool; email BGS Data Services asking whether
  an unlisted LithoFrame model covers the site (cheap per-km² if so).
- Harvested from rejected sites: carvable-undercroft mechanic + crown-hole unknown-void
  hazard (Nottingham); fossil-in-the-dressed-stone zoom detail (Dudley's reef limestone →
  ours via Durham's Frosterley Marble); medieval mine workings as unrecorded voids (MRA).
- Fire honest gaps: no in-window bucket chains (tubs + hooks only); no "bells rung backwards";
  never quote "3,000 dead in 1212" as fact (Stow 1603 legend).
- Occupational-surname coalescence (§7) — delightful, but confirm it doesn't complicate
  save-format identity; people need stable IDs independent of display names.
- Port decision Electron vs Tauri deferred to M7; nothing before then may depend on either.
